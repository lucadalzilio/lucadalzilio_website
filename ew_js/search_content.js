However, their relative significance and relevant spatial and temporal scales remain uncertain. Integrative modeling of earthquake source processes is critically needed to deliver transformative science that capitalizes on recent progress in seismic, geodetic, geologic, laboratory, and numerical studies. To answer these questions, my research aim to develop and apply physics-based computational methods that can address the interplay between long-term tectonics and rapid and localized earthquake source processes, including multiple temporal scales (dynamic rupture, interseismic period\/earthquake sequences, and tectonic deformation), multiple spatial scales (fault core, fault segment, and network), and multiple physical and chemical factors (fluid effects, metamorphic reactions, realistic geometry, and inelastic processes). RESEARCH How do earthquakes start? How do slow-slip events and earthquakes interact in space and time? Faults accommodate deformation with a variety of different mechanisms that vary in space and time. Slip phenomena outside earthquake rupture, which include transient creep, slow-slip events, and afterslip, are characterized by slip velocities that vary by many orders of magnitude, from a few millimeter per year to meters per second. The spatial and temporal history of fault slip undoubtedly influences the location, timing, and size of future earthquakes. As such, I develop earthquake cycle models that simulate the behavior of fault systems over many earthquake cycles, which include periods of slow tectonic loading and aseismic slip, earthquake nucleation, coseismic rupture, and afterslip\/postseismic relaxation processes that are essential to understanding the behavior of seismogenic faults. How can pore fluids in fault zones affect and trigger slow-slip events and earthquakes? Pore fluids, ubiquitous in nature, have profound effects on fault structures. Their presence, chemistry, and movement can dramatically alter the rheological properties of the bulk rocks, compressive stresses felt across faults, fault loading, and shear resistance of the slipping layers. At the same time, earthquakes also directly affect the hydrogeological structure: fault rock damage can create permeability pathways that heal after an earthquake and seismic waves can increase permeability even at great distance. A major challenge in earthquake physics is to incorporate a fully coupled hydro-seismological modeling over the entire temporal and spatial scales of deformation. To address this challenge, I develope two-phase flow numerical models — which couples solid rock deformation and pervasive fluid flow — to investigate how crustal stress and fluid pressure evolve along fluid-bearing fault structures before and during slow-slip events and earthquakes. This unified numerical framework accounts for full inertial (wave) effects and fluid flow in a poro-visco-elasto-plastic compressible medium. This new method contributes to improve our understanding of earthquake source processes along fluid-bearing fault structures, and demonstrate that fluids play a key role in controlling the interplay between seismic and aseismic slip.

Whether slow-slip events and regular earthquakes result from a similar physics is debated. In this project we present numerical simulations to show that slow-slip events can result from frictional sliding like seismic slip, with an additional mechanism of shear-induced dilatancy that prevents acceleration to fast slip due to the presence of fluids. The model succeeds in reproducing a realistic sequence of slow-slip events and provides an excellent match to the observations from the Cascadia subduction zone, including the earthquake-like cubicmoment-duration scaling. In contrast to conventional and widely used assumptions of magnitude-invariant rupture velocities and stress drops, both simulated and natural SSEs have rupture velocities and stress dropsthat increase with event magnitudes. These findings support the same frictional origin for both earthquakes and SSEs while suggesting a new explanation for the observed SSEs scaling. Scaling properties of slow-slip events LUCA DAL ZILIO PROJECTS Nowadays, the scientific dispute as to whether vertical or horizontal forces are the primary drivers of mountain building seems settled in favor of horizontal forces. For the central European Alps, however, this concept fails to explain first-order observations of a mountain belt. Recent stratigraphic, palaeo-altimetry and lithosphere structural evidence suggest that a rollback orogeny model is capable of explaining the construction of thick nappe successions and the large-scale evolution of the Swiss Alps. In this project we investigate this hypothesis using a high-resolution, rheologically consistent, two-dimensional visco-elasto-plastic thermo-mechanical numerical model. We conduct a set of numerical experiments in which we systematically vary several major parameters responsible for the degree of rheological coupling between platesduring collision. The driving forces of orogeny are solely provided by the structure within the model, i.e., by the oceanic slab and the buoyancy of the crust. Our model reproduces the self-consistent stages of oceanic subduction, continent-continent collision, spontaneous slab breakoff and subsequent evolution of the orogen. This leads to the coeval stackingof the crustal root in the lower plate and widening of the orogen. In particular, we discuss how the current crustal seismicity pattern implies the occurrence of extensional forces at work beneath the Molasse Basin and within the Alps. Our results thus support the emerging hypothesis that the remaining slab exerts a first-order control on the motions and deformations of the orogen. Slab Rollback Orogeny model: bridging long-term tectonics and seismicity in the Alps Modeling sequences of seismic and aseismic deformation in a nonlinear viscoelastic megathrust A major goal in earthquake physics is to develop a constitutive framework for fault slip that captures the dependence of shear strength on sliding velocity, nonlinear rheology, and temperature. In this project, we present VELO2CYCLEs (Visco-ELastO 2-D Cycles of Earthquakes), a two-dimensional (2-D) thermo-mechanical computational framework for simulating earthquake sequences in a nonlinear viscoelastic compressible media. The method is developed for a plane-strain problem and incorporates an invariant formulation of the classical rate- and state-dependent friction equations and an adaptive time-stepping that allows the time step to vary by many orders of magnitude during a simulation. The new method provides a unique computational framework to analyze earthquake sequences and connect forearc deformation with the dynamic properties of the megathrust, thus providing a physical link between observations of individual earthquakes and postseismic deformation with geological observations of long-term tectonic deformation. Fluid-driven earthquake sequences and aseismic slip in a poro-visco-elasto-plastic fluid-bearing fault structure There is a growing interest in understanding how geologic faults respond to transient sources of fluid. However, the spatio-temporal evolution of sequences of seismic and aseismic slip in response to pore-fluid evolution is still poorly constrained. In this study, we present H-MEC (Hydro-Mechanical Earthquake Cycles), a newly-developed two-phase flow numerical code — which couples solid rock deformation and pervasive fluid flow — to simulate how crustal stress and fluid pressure evolve during the earthquake cycle on a fluid-bearing fault structure. This unified 2D numerical framework accounts for full inertial (wave) effects and fluid flow in a finite difference method and poro-visco-elasto-plastic compressible medium. This method is developed for both in-plane and anti-plane strike-slip setups in which we test analytical benchmarks of pore-fluid pressure diffusion from an injection point. In these models, the onset of fluid-driven shear cracks is controlled by localized collapse of pores and dynamic self-pressurization of fluids inside the undrained fault zone, subsequent dynamic ruptures are driven by solitary pulse-like fluid pressure wave propagating at seismic speed. This numerical framework provides a viable tool to better understand fluid-driven dynamic ruptures, either as a natural process or induced by human activities.","tags":"","url":"projects.html","UUID":"4BD54E05723947328DAF2EF71E087BB9"},{"title":"Team","text":" LUCA DAL ZILIO TEAM Dr. Xiaoyu Wang Post-doctoral scholar, Dept. of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering (advisors: Prof. Dr. David Kammer; Dr. Luca Dal Zilio) Seismic and aseismic slip on rough faults using Discrete-Element-Method numerical simulations Betti Hegyi PhD student, Dept. of Earth Sciences (supervisors: Prof. Dr. Whitney Behr; Dr. Luca Dal Zilio) The role of fluids in earthquake cycles using seismo-hydro-mechanical numerical models Jiayi Ye Master student, Dept. of Earth Sciences (supervisor: Dr. Luca Dal Zilio) Fluid-driven foreshock sequences controlled by permeability barriers Danyang Jiang Master student, Dept. of Earth Sciences (supervisor: Dr. Luca Dal Zilio) Fault valving and permeability evolution in a fluid-bearing fault structure","tags":"","url":"team.html","UUID":"317974BC5DFD469FB85515D8286BBD32"},{"title":"Opportunities","text":" B.Sc. and M.Sc. projects I am currently looking for motivated, ambitious, and curious students.
